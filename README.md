## ℹ️ General info

MultistepForm in React using (Formik, react-hook-form, own script)

## 🎉 Project Overview

This is an application that was intended to teach me how to use the tools, i.e. Formik, or react-hook-form, and recreate the multistep form logic myself.

## 📖 What I learned during this project?

The biggest problem with this application was understanding how the application is supposed to work and how the form state is supposed to be passed. Another problem was handling form errors
